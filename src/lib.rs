//! Create and spawn processes inside a pseudoterminal in Windows.
//!
//! This crate provides an abstraction over different backend implementations to spawn PTY processes in Windows.
//! Right now this library supports using [`WinPTY`] and [`ConPTY`].
//!
//! The abstraction is represented through the [`PTY`] struct, which declares methods to initialize, spawn, read,
//! write and get diverse information about the state of a process that is running inside a pseudoterminal.
//!
